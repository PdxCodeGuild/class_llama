      <p>Khalil (or Kahlil) Gibran is a Lebanese-American writer, poet, and artist, most famous for his book the Prophet (first published in the United States in 1923 and since translated into more than 100 languages).<br>Born in 1883, Gibran spent the earliest years of his life in an Ottoman-ruled village in Lebanon. In 1895, Gibran and his family immigrated to the United States, where they settled in Boston, Massachusetts.<br>Throughout his life, he lived and/or attended school in the following places:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Bsharri Village, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire</li>
        <li>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</li>
        <li>Beirut, Lebanon, USA</li>
        <li>Paris, France, USA</li>
        <li>New York, New York, USA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gibran initially achieved success as a visual artist, with his first drawings displayed at a studio in Boston. The very next year, his first Arabic book was published in New York, along with his first English book a few years later. More of his art was later displayed at multiple other studios in Boston and New York, and an abundance of his other pieces of writing were published in both Arabic and English (many of which have since been translated into additional languages). While he wrote in many different styles - poetry, short stories, essays, letters, and plays, among others - his most notable piece of writing by far is the Prophet, made up of 26 prose poetry fables. It touches on the many facets of life, including love, beauty, and relationships, and it is renowned for its lessons in philosophy, spirituality, and inspiration. The one millionth copy was sold in 1957, and to date over nine million copies have been sold of the English version alone.</p>
      <p>Gibran died primarily from cirrhosis of the liver, and many more previously unseen works of art were displayed and pieces of writing published in the years following his death.</p>
      <p>The largest collection in the United States of Gibran's visual art is currently housed at a museum in Georgia. A museum dedicated to Gibran and his works now stands in his birth village in modern-day Lebanon, to which he also pledged all future royalties on his books.</p>
