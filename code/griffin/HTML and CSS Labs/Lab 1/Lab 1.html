    <div class = "article">The life of Ser Franzibald Langinus Witherspoon Twitwither XXXIV was one of great triumph over adversity. Raised on a modest 40 million dollars
      estate, Twitwither was trained from an early age on the management of multi-national corporations, taking such courses as: polo watching, Fashion coaching,
      and High Functioning Alcoholism. Shortly after graduating college, Twitwither pursued his passion of Yacht entrepreneurship, wherein he purchased yachts.
      Having inherited a mere $8 billion dollars at the tender age of 32, he took courageous charge of the family business and managed to grow the estate to be valued at an unprecedented $50,000. Shortly after this 
      resounding success, he was immolated by an enormous dragon and spent the next 100 years as the chairman of the board of Directors at a prestigious policy
      institute, overcoming the fact that he was now made entirely of ash. Twitwither was known for his citizenship in dozens of micronations around the world, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Molossia</li>
            <li>Aeterna Lucina</li>
            <li>British West Florida</li>
            <li>Filettino</li>
            <li>Melchizedek</li>
            <li>Other World Kingdom</li>
            <li>Zaqistan</li>
        </ul>
        It is rumored that Twitwither used the majority of his family's wealth to purchase citizenship in these nations, which he described as: <blockquote>"really a great deal,
         <strong>I mean think of what you're getting.</strong> You're getting in on the ground floor of something real swell, just absolutely the best. I mean think 
        about it, someday these tiny countries are gonna start a war, and they're gonna lose, and then there will be contracts for rebuilding those countries. And who are 
        they gonna award those contracts to? Citizens of the nation, obviously. It's just a matter of time before this all pays off"</blockquote>

    <footer>As of this writing, the Twitwither corporation had secured no micronation reconstruction contracts. As we all know, following his success as the chairman 
      of the Modern Policy for We, the Billionaires Foundation, Twitwither was pressurized into a diamond, at which point he was made Supreme Galactic Overlord,
      ruling over his benevolent empire from his palace on Titan. His righteous war to defend freedom, which mainly composed of bombing the moons of Saturn with nuclear 
      warheads, was deemed a rousing success as, following the bombing, no moon-people could be found on Titan.
      While Information about Belevolent Galactic Overlord-Chairman Twitwither is hard to find online, substantial information is available 
        on Twitwither's closest childhood friend, known during his youth as: 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr."> "Stinky Ronnie".</a><br>
