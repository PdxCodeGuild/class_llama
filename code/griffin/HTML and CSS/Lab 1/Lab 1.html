    <h1>Visionary, Firebrand, Primarily Composed of Carbon</h1>
    <article>The life of Ser Langibus Witherspoon Twitwither XXXIV was one of great triumph over adversity. Having inherited a mere $8 billion dollars at the tender
        age of 32, he took courageous charge of the family business and managed to grow the estate to be valued at an unprecedented $50,000. Shortly after this 
        resounding success, he was immolated by an enormous dragon and spent the next 100 years as the chairman of the board of Directors at a prestigious policy
        institute, overcoming the fact that he was now made entirely of ash. Twitwither was known for his citizenship in dozens of micronations around the world, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Molossia</li>
            <li>Aeterna Lucina</li>
            <li>British West Florida</li>
            <li>Filettino</li>
            <li>Melchizedek</li>
            <li>Other World Kingdom</li>
            <li>Zaqistan</li>
        </ul>
        It is rumored that Twitwither used the majority of his family's wealth to purchase citizenship in these nations, which he described as: <blockquote>"really a great deal,
         <strong></strong>I mean think of what you're getting.</strong> You're getting in on the ground floor of something real swell, just absolutely the best. I mean think 
        about it, someday these tiny countries are gonna start a war, and they're gonna lose, and then there will be contracts for rebuilding those countries. And who are 
        they gonna award those contracts to? Citizens of the nation, obviously. It's just a matter of time before this all pays off"</blockquote>

        on Twitwither's closest childhood friend, known during his youth as "Stinky Ronnie".</a><br>
