    <h1>Visionary, Firebrand, Primarily Composed of Carbon</h1>
    <p>The life of Ser Langibus Witherspoon Twitwither XXXIV was one of great triumph over adversity. Having inherited a mere $8 billion dollars at the tender
        age of 32, he took courageous charge of the family business and managed to grow the estate to be valued at an unprecedented $50,000. Shortly after this 
        resounding success, he was immolated by an enormous dragon and spent the next 100 years as the chairman of the board of Directors at a prestigious policy
        institute, overcoming the fact that he was now made entirely of ash. Twitwither was known for his citizenship in dozens of micronations around the world, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Molossia</li>
            <li>Aeterna Lucina</li>
            <li>British West Florida</li>
            <li>Filettino</li>
            <li>Melchizedek</li>
            <li>Other World Kingdom</li>
            <li>Zaqistan</li>
        </ul>
        It is rumored that Twitwither used the majority of his family's wealth to purchase citizenship in these nations, which he described as "really a great deal, I mean
        think of what you're getting. You're getting in on the ground floor of something real swell, just absolutely the best."
