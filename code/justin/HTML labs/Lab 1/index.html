        <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch">David Keith Lynch</a></b>
        is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, singer, sound designer, 
        photographer, and actor. He is best known for writing and directing 
        films such as <i>Eraserhead</i>, <i>The Elephant Man</i>, <i>Blue 
        Velvet</i>, and <i>Muholland Drive</i> - which are often regarded by 
        critics as among the best films of their times - and for his television 
        series <i>Twin Peaks</i>. These works led to him being labeled "the 
        first popular Surrealist" by film critic Pauline Kael.

        "I look at the world and I see absurdity all around me. 
        People do strange things constantly, to the point that, 
        for the most part, we manage not to see it. That's why I 
        love coffee shops and public places - I mean, they're 
        all out there."
