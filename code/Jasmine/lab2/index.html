        <h2>Her Story.</h2>
        <p>I was assigned to SGS Transportation in Heidelberg, Germany as a driver. This particular time I was assigned to pick up a 2 Star General from Frankfort and take him and his luggage to Nuremberg. It seemed like any other mission until we were on the Autobahn. This Army General started asking questions about my name, where I was from and such. As we were talking he unbuckled his lap belt and moved to the seat right behind me. He started telling me all the things he’d like to do sexually to me and with me while he was “in town”. The things he suggested made my skin crawl! He was talking as if I’d been assigned to him, like a call girl. He kept caressing my shoulders and was trying to touch my breasts. I was driving and still several hours from Nuremberg. I did what I could to shrug him off but he would not stop touching me. Each time saying “Don’t get upset, I’m just trying to relax your tension.I want us to get along while we’re together,”. I wanted to scream but the only thing I could do was drive faster. When we got to the Hotel in Nuremberg I dropped him at the door and went to park the van. When I got into the hotel to receive the key to my shared room for the night, he was waiting for me with a drink in his hand. He tried to hand me one, but I refused. He then became upset, like I was being rude. I apologized but told him I had to use the restroom and headed for the elevator as quick as I could. Unfortunately, he was right on my heels. I was trapped in the elevator with him. He was grabbing my ass and trying to kiss me. It felt like his hands were everywhere at once. He didn’t seem to understand what “Please Stop” meant.

        <h2>His Story.</h2>
        <p>I served in the Marine Corps from 2001 to 2003. My Gunny and Chief Warrant Officer would often find me to embarrass me in front of my peers. I was a big guy and had on-again, off-again issues with my weight.
        While in CAX in 29 Palms California, my uncle passed away and I was not able to pay my respects per the decision of the Gunny and Chief Warrant Officer, who prevented me from being at the funeral. That evening after work, I had a few too many drinks at the Warriors Club and bowling alley. On orders from the Gunny and Chief Warrant Officer, my peers in the unit transported me back to the barracks in a Humvee. At that time, unit members were also ordered to disrobe me and shower me. I was in tears and attempted to resist. I pleaded with them to leave me be and not to put their hands on me

        <h2>Her Story.</h2>
        <p> It was July of 2017, I had been in the Navy for about a year and a half and was 20 years old. At this time, I was recently advanced to E4 and thought my life and career was thriving. One evening, I was invited to a Game of Thrones watch party with some of my coworkers. I drove myself to the apartment of an E5 in my division and upon arrival, noticed that a man that I had previously dated for about a month earlier that year was also there, we’ll call him “D.” I didn’t really think anything dangerous of this because we had ended things on good terms. At the beginning of the night, I was drinking a few beers and we were playing card and drinking games, something fairly typical in the Navy. Although the matter of what I was wearing has no relevance or reasoning as to what happened to me, it sets the tone for this next fact; I had been wearing a white wife beater (with no bra underneath) and jeans. D had been taking photos and videos of me, primarily of my breasts, and sending them to his friends on snapchat. At the time, I wasn’t a very confrontational person, and nervously laughed it off. As the night progressed, D had started to place beers in front of me as soon as I’d finished the one prior. Those beers quickly turned to shots and mixed drinks. At one point, he invited me into the kitchen with him while he made me another. D had grabbed me and began kissing me, whispering “I miss us.” I will admit, I was drunk and made that statement back. When we sat down at the table, he was holding my hand under the table and playing footsies with me.</p>
