        <br> <blockquote><i>"Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory, or an acceptance of the way things are. It's a 
            celebration of progress. It's an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of history, change is possible --- and 
            there is still so much work to do."</i> </blockquote>
        <p>Barack Hussein Obama II (born August 4, 1961) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th president 
            of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Barack Obama was the first African-American
            president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois
            state senator from 1997 to 2004. </p>

        <p> Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, making him the first president not born in the contiguous United States. After graduating 
            from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School,
            where he was the first black person to be president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights 
            attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning 
            to elective politics, he represented the 13th district from 1997 until 2004 in the Illinois Senate, when he ran for the 
            U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic 
            National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for 
            president a year after his presidential campaign began, and after close primary campaigns against Hillary Clinton.
            Obama was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated alongside Joe Biden on January 20, 2009. 
            Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. </p>
