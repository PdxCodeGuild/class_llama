# Idea for Mini Capstone: ****U/Record**** (possible name for the web app)


# My mini capstone would be a start to help struggling artists with a free, simple, and easy to use
# recording online web app! Record original music or voice over work. All the features needed to 
# record a decent .wav or .mp3 file are all included. Create an account on Soundcloud.com or a 
# YouTube Artist Channel and upload your recordings! As well as eliminate record labels and all the hassles
# with "fine print" in record contracts! Create an album, go to 'https://cdbaby.com/' and they distribute to 
# a lot of websites (iTunes, Amazon Prime, Google Music, YouTube Music and Spotify) where people can purchase 
# your album or songs.

"""
Might lead into the final Capstone Project
Potential to add music theory (notation)
Metronome or Back Beat to play along with...
Potential for partnerships with existing entities in Music and Entertainment Industry!
