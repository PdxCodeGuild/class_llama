# Idea for Mini Capstone: ****U/Record**** a FREE web app

# My mini capstone would be a start to help struggling artists with a free, simple, and easy to use
# recording online web app! Record original music or voice over work. All the features needed to 
# record a decent .wav or .mp3 file are all included. Create an account on Soundcloud.com or a 
# YouTube Artist Channel and upload your recordings!

"""
Might lead into the final Capstone Project
Potential to add music theory (notation)
Metronome or Back Beat to play along with...
Use an Audio Converter program to convert mp3 to FLAC (Lossless) file for higher quality sound
