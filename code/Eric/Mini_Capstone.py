# Idea for Mini Capstone

# My mini capstone would be a start to help struggling artists with a free, simple, and easy to use
# recording online web app! Record original music or voice over work. All the features needed to 
# record a decent .wav or .mp3 file are all included. Create an account on Soundcloud.com or a 
# YouTube Artist Channel and upload your recordings! As well as eliminate record labels and all the hassles
# with "fine print" in record contracts! Create an album, go to 'www.cdbaby.com' and they distribute to 
# a lot of websites (iTunes, Amazon Prime, Google Music, YouTube Music and Spotify) where people can purchase 
# your album or songs.
